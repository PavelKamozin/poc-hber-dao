 * This is a singleton class with all its public methods exposed as REST APIs via generated controller class.
 * To avoid exposing an API for a particular public method, annotate it with @HideFromClient.
 *
 * Method names will play a major role in defining the Http Method for the generated APIs. For example, a method name
 * that starts with delete/remove, will make the API exposed as Http Method "DELETE".
 *
 * Method Parameters of type primitives (including java.lang.String) will be exposed as Query Parameters &
 * Complex Types/Objects will become part of the Request body in the generated API.
 *
 * NOTE: We do not recommend using method overloading on client exposed methods.
